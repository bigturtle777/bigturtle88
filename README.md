<h2> üëã Hello there! I'm Vyacheslav</h2>

### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª &nbsp;About Me

I have over 11 years in the IT industry. \
I have over 6 years of web development experience. \
I like startups and everything connected with them. What could be more amazing than creating the world from one idea? :) 

I practice a systematic understanding of the project at each stage of development. I understand how sales, marketing, developers, managers work. This gives me the opportunity to become a translator between these specialists.
